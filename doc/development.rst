Developing with csspin-workflows
================================

The following sections provide information on how to develop the and with the
plugins provided by ``csspin-workflows``.

Developing workflows
====================

The :ref:`csspin-workflows.stdworkflows` plugin provides a way to run multiple spin
tasks in sequence with a single command using so-called "workflows". Plugins
that want to make use of pre-defined workflows can do so by decorating their
tasks with the ``@task(when="...")`` decorator.

It is required that a task that is decorated using ``@task(when="...")`` is
implementing *all* of the parameters and their respective type annotations of
the underlying workflow. Otherwise the execution of a workflow including this
misconfigured task will fail.

Please refer to the source code of the :ref:`csspin_workflows.stdworkflows` plugin for
more information about the required parameters and their type annotations.
