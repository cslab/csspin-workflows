# Development and Contributing Guide

This document provides instructions for users, developers, and maintainers who
want to share ideas, report issues, contribute code, or create releases for the
csspin-workflows project.

The csspin-workflows repository is hosted on a private GitLab instance, while
the repository itself is mirrored to
[GitHub](https://github.com/cslab/csspin-workflows) for public visibility.

## Development Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/) or
  [prek](https://pypi.org/project/prek/)
- System requirements as documented in the
  [documentation](doc/installation.rst)

## Contribution Guidelines

Please follow the guidelines below when contributing to the csspin-workflows
project.

### Reporting Issues

Reporting bugs and proposing features is an important part of the development
process, so please feel free to report any issues you encounter _before_
proposing code contributions.

External contributors should use the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/cslab/csspin-workflows/issues) for reporting
issues while CONTACT Software Group GmbH internal contributors can use the
GitLab issue tracker.

### Code Contributions

Code contributions are welcome from both internal and external contributors.
Please follow these steps considering code contributions:

1. If you are planning to work on a new feature or bugfix, please make sure to
   create an issue first. This avoids duplicate work and helps identify the if
   the change is aligned with the project's goals. Discuss the proposed changes
   in the issue and get it approved by a maintainer.
2. After the issue is created, assigned, and agreed upon, work on your changes
   in the forked repository (for external contributors) or new branch (for
   CONTACT-internal contributions). Once the implementing is started or done,
   create a pull or merge request _draft_ targeting the master branch, linking
   the related issue, and assigning yourself.
3. Before marking the request as ready for review, make sure to address all of
   the following points:
    - [ ] All tests pass
    - [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass
    - [ ] Relevant tests have been added or updated (if necessary)
    - [ ] The documentation has been updated (if necessary)
    - [ ] The code is sufficiently documented (docstrings, comments, etc.)
    - [ ] The changes adhere to the project's coding standards including:
        - Pre-Commit hooks and their configuration
        - Standards and best practices as described in
          [csspin](https://csspin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)'s documentation
        - CONTACT-internal coding guidelines (mostly covered by pre-commit
          hooks, but the reviewer might ask for additional changes)
    - [ ] Take your time to prepare the code and merge/pull request description
          before marking the request as ready for review. A well-prepared
          request will save a lot of time during the review process.
4. Mark the request as ready for review and assign a reviewer (usually a
   maintainer).
5. Wait for the review to be completed. Address any feedback provided by the
   reviewer.
6. Once the review is approved and all checks pass, the request can be merged
   into the master branch. This is usually done by one of the maintainers. (For
   pull requests from external contributors on GitHub, a maintainer will take
   over the changes and create a corresponding merge request on GitLab, as the
   GitHub repository is only the push mirror target.)

The following example demonstrates the typical workflow for contributing code to
csspin-workflows:

1. Create an issue, discuss the proposed changes, and get it approved.
2. Fork the repository (GitHub) or create a new branch (GitLab).
3. `git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url> csspin-workflows && cd csspin-workflows && pre-commit install`
4. `uv venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
   (to set up the development environment)
5. Implement the changes (code, tests, documentation, etc.).
6. Run tests to ensure everything works as expected, e.g. via `pytest tests/`
7. Commit your changes with descriptive messages and ensure all pre-commit hooks
   pass.
8. Create a pull or merge request targeting the master branch, linking the
   related issue, documenting changes and considerations, and assigning
   yourself.
9. Mark the request as ready for review and assign a reviewer.
10. Address any feedback from the reviewer.
11. Once approved, a maintainer will merge or take over the request.

## Release Procedure

> This section is only relevant for maintainers of the csspin-workflows project.

The version scheme used is major.minor.patch following semver.org.

Releases are created by csspin-workflows maintainers within the GitLab instance
hosting this repository.

Steps to create a release:

0. Preparations
    - Verify that all relevant changes are merged into the master branch, which
      is the source for all releases.
    - Also make sure that the latest non-scheduled master pipeline is green.
    - Ensure that release related merge request and issues are labeled and
      closed properly.
    - If there is a milestone, make sure that all tasks are done.

1. Create the release notes by opening a new merge request at the
   csspin-workflows repository in GitLab targeting the master branch and adding
   a new section to the `doc/relnotes.rst` file. Follow the instructions given
   in that file regarding the format of the release notes. Once the merge
   request is reviewed and approved, merge it into master.

2. After the release notes have been merged and the master pipeline is green,
   create the actual release within GitLab by creating a new tag with the scheme
   "v<major>.<minor>.<patch>" (e.g. "v2.1.0" for version 2.1.0).

3. Hit "Create tag" ✨

4. [optional] If the change need to be distributed within the
   [cetest](https://code.contact.de/qs/images/cetest) image, follow the release
   procedure there.

5. [optional] Create a Demo It! demonstrating the latest improvements of
   csspin-workflows.
